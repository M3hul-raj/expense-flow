# ExpenseFlow: Developer & Architecture Guide

Welcome to the internal documentation for **ExpenseFlow**. This guide is designed for developers, engineering managers, and technical recruiters to understand the underlying architecture, data flow, and design decisions of the application. 

If you are a developer looking to contribute or understand the codebase, this document serves as your complete "under the hood" manual.

## 1. Executive Architecture Summary

ExpenseFlow is a production-grade, full-stack web application built on a modern Python backend (Flask) with a custom, highly interactive vanilla JavaScript/CSS frontend. It uses the **application factory pattern** (`create_app()`) with **Flask Blueprints** and strictly implements the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern through server-side rendering (SSR):

*   **Model (`models.py`)**: Defines the SQLite database structure using SQLAlchemy ORM.
*   **View (`templates/`, `static/`)**: Jinja2 HTML templates styled with a completely custom CSS design system (`main.css`), featuring dynamic JavaScript interactivity without heavy frontend frameworks.
*   **Controller (`app.py` + `blueprints/`)**: The application factory in `app.py` wires extensions and registers 5 blueprints (`auth`, `expenses`, `budget`, `analytics`, `main`) that contain all route logic. Shared utilities live in `utils.py`, and extension instances (CSRF, rate limiter) are defined in `extensions.py` to avoid circular imports.

## 3. Database Schema & Indexing

The application relies on three distinct relational tables mapped by SQLAlchemy, heavily optimized for read-heavy financial filtering.

1.  **User (`id`, `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `recurring_budget`, `registration_date`, `avatar`, `display_name`)**
    *   The parent table utilizing Werkzeug `pbkdf2:sha256` password hashing.
2.  **Expense (`id`, `user_id`, `date`, `category`, `amount`, `description`, `payment_method`, `created_at`)**
    *   Linked to `User` via foreign key `user_id`.
    *   **Optimization:** Utilizes a **composite index** on `(user_id, date)` ensuring that complex month-over-month queries execute in $O(\log n)$ time.
    *   Categories and payment methods are validated server-side against strict whitelists.
3.  **Budget (`id`, `user_id`, `year_month`, `amount`)**
    *   Linked to `User` via foreign key `user_id` with a unique constraint on `(user_id, year_month)`.
    *   If a specific month's budget is not set, the backend dynamically falls back to the user's `recurring_budget` or standard default.

> [!WARNING]
> **Cascade Deletes** are enforced at the ORM level. Deleting a User will automatically trigger the deletion of all their associated Expenses and Budgets to maintain referential integrity.

## 4. Key Technical Implementations (The "Magic")

### A. Flawless Dark/Light Mode via CSS Variables
Instead of relying on utility-first frameworks (like Tailwind) which clutter HTML, ExpenseFlow uses a highly scalable CSS Variable Architecture.
*   The `:root` pseudo-class defines the default Light Mode design tokens (e.g., `--bg-color: #F8FAFC`).
*   The `[data-theme="dark"]` attribute overrides these exact variables with dark variants.
*   This structural isolation prevents "mode contamination" and allows smooth `transition` animations across the entire application simultaneously.

### B. Algorithmic "GitHub-Style" Calendar Heatmap
Generating the 7-column calendar heatmap is done entirely from scratch without heavy charting libraries:
*   **Backend (`app.py`):** The python controller finds the user's maximum spending day for the selected month. It then calculates an `intensity` ratio (0.0 to 1.0) for every other day relative to that maximum.
*   **Frontend (`analytics.html`):** CSS Grid structures the days, and the Jinja2 template dynamically injects the calculated intensity into the `opacity` style attribute of each cell, creating a visually accurate, data-driven heatmap.

### C. Dynamic PDF Document Generation
The `/export/pdf` route utilizes the **ReportLab (`Platypus` engine)** to generate professional financial reports.
*   The PDF is generated dynamically in server memory using `io.BytesIO()`, ensuring zero disk-space bloat on the server.
*   It features custom table styling, pagination, and dynamic headers based on the current user's session data.

### D. Progressive Web App (PWA) Offline Resilience
The application utilizes a custom Service Worker (`sw.js`) to intercept network requests:
*   **Cache-First Strategy:** Static assets (CSS, logos, JS) are served instantly from the local cache.
*   **Network-First Strategy:** HTML pages attempt to fetch fresh data from the server, but gracefully fall back to a custom `offline.html` page if the user loses connectivity.

### E. High-Fidelity Glassmorphism & Animations
The landing page implements high-end visual design techniques seen in top-tier SaaS platforms.
*   **Glow Orb & Frosted Glass:** A heavily blurred, absolutely positioned `.hero-glow-orb` div sits behind the cards. The cards utilize `backdrop-filter: blur(24px)` to allow the gradient to organically bleed through the UI.
*   **Staggered Entrance Velocity:** Cards trigger a `slideUpFadeIn` entrance animation on load with staggered delays (`--enter-delay`), before gracefully transitioning into an infinite, multi-layered CSS keyframe float.

### F. True Velocity "Burn Rate" Analytics
Instead of simply dividing total monthly spend by 30 days, the Dashboard dynamically computes the user's "True Velocity".
*   It calculates the exact number of days that have passed in the current month to date (`max(1, datetime.now().day)`).
*   Dividing current spending by this exact integer gives an aggressive, highly accurate daily burn rate that forces real-time financial accountability.

### G. CSRF Protection & Login Rate Limiting
All POST forms include a hidden `csrf_token()` field validated by **Flask-WTF's CSRFProtect**. Extension instances are defined in `extensions.py` (not in `app.py`) to avoid circular imports with blueprints.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Flask-Limiter enforces **5 POST requests per 15 minutes** on `/login`. The `on_breach` callback returns a proper `make_response(render_template('login.html'), 429)` — not a raw string — so the styled login page renders correctly on the 429 response.
*   **Testing:** CSRF is disabled in the test configuration (`WTF_CSRF_ENABLED=False`) so functional tests can POST without tokens. Two dedicated tests re-enable CSRF to verify rejection without a valid token.

### H. Automated Testing & CI
The `tests/` directory contains **26 pytest tests** covering:
*   **Expense CRUD** — add, edit, delete with server-side validation (negative amounts, future dates, invalid categories)
*   **Cross-user isolation** — one user cannot edit/delete another user's expenses (returns 404)
*   **Budget logic** — default budget, explicit budget row, recurring fallback, override priority
*   **CSRF enforcement** — POST without token returns 400

Tests run against an isolated **in-memory SQLite database** created via `create_app('testing')` — the production `expenses.db` is never touched. **GitHub Actions CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `pytest tests/ -v` on every push and pull request to `main`.
